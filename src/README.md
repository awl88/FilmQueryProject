### Week 6 Homework for Skill Distillery

#### Technologies Used
* Java classes
* for loops
* MySQL
* Eclipse
* Git/GitHub

#### Project Description
This project is a simple program that uses mySQL to get film information from a database.

#### How to Run This Program
To use this program, simply run it and enter information when prompted. 

#### Lessons Learned
The main thing I learned working on this project was to check your mySQL code, and then check
it again, because if you have the wrong information in it, it will cause some kind of bug in
your program. Figuring out the bug, and how to fix it was difficult, but once I figured it out
it was a rewarding finish.
